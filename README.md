# spark-scenario
## Setup (create development environment)
1. See the video and follow each steps he described --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Lbz_HqW9I
2. Mandatory --> python version 3.10, jdk-1.8
3. In this project, I created a spark_session.py module where spark session is created, 
and export all necessary libraries.
4. When you just copy and paste from specific scenario consider the spark-session.py and set jdk file path as yours.
5. There is pandas solution also in the "Pandas Solution" folder. But for this you have to install "pandas". 
    --> go to terminal --> pip install pandas --> hit enter
